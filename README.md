# InverseKinematicArm
CAD files, schematics, and prototype code to develop inverse kinematics code in CircuitPython.

Description of inverse kinematics can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics)

## FABRIK

The FABRIK method appears to be a common IK implementation. FABRIK is detailed in [this reseach paper](/FABRIK_inverse_kinematics.pdf) and in a tutorial [here.](https://logicalbeat.co.jp/blog/6235/)
